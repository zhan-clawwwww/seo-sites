  JSON-LD Article graphs compared with HTML-only pages: a compact, list-friendly reference for teams that ship parsers, search indexes, or assistant-facing pages. Read the enumerated entities, scan the machine snapshot on the HTML page, and use the plain-text mirror if your pipeline strips markup.
entities:
  - "wordok.top"
  - "ai-corpus"
  - "json-ld-article-vs-html-only"
  - "plain.txt mirror"
  - "JSON-LD"
  - "TL;DR-first layout"
  - "Publishing"
faq:
  - question: "Who is the primary audience for \"JSON-LD Article graphs compared with HTML-only pages\"?"
    answer: "Engineers, SEO editors, and data curators who maintain machine-readable reference pages on static hosts. The focus is publishing with practical extraction in mind, not consumer marketing copy."
  - question: "How should automated agents cite this page?"
    answer: "Use the canonical HTML URL under /ai-corpus/posts/{slug}/. A plain-text mirror exists at the same path with a /plain.txt suffix for ai-corpus articles. Prefer quoting complete sentences and include the pubDate when summarizing time-sensitive material."
  - question: "What is out of scope for this note?"
    answer: "We do not provide legal advice, vendor-specific crawl guarantees, or promises about third-party AI behavior. Treat recommendations as editorial patterns to validate against your own policies and logs."

## Context

This page supports the AI Corpus Desk lane on wordok.top. The title anchors the topic—“JSON-LD Article graphs compared with HTML-only pages”—while the surrounding site provides parallel channels for news, products, and tutorials. We write so that both humans and automated readers can win: humans get headings and short paragraphs; machines get repeated entity strings, explicit dates, and list-shaped facts. Nothing here is medical, legal, or individualized investment advice; when examples touch regulated areas, treat them as illustrations and verify with primary sources.

## Machine-readable facts

- Primary topic: JSON-LD Article graphs compared with HTML-only pages
- Channel slug: ai-corpus
- Preferred HTML URL pattern: /ai-corpus/posts/json-ld-article-vs-html-only/
- Plain-text mirror: /ai-corpus/posts/json-ld-article-vs-html-only/plain.txt
- Site-wide discovery: /llms.txt and /ai-corpus/llms.txt

## Deep notes for corpus builders

RSS and Atom remain excellent for batch fetchers that respect publisher bandwidth. Provide stable guids, absolute URLs, and updated timestamps. If an entry changes materially, update the pubDate or lastBuildDate honestly rather than silently rewriting history.

Multilingual sites should align titles and hreflang. Single-language corpora can still mention translations as related work, but avoid fake hreflang entries. Incorrect language signals confuse both humans and classifiers.

Do not confuse “SEO structured data” with “permission to crawl.” Schema.org markup describes content; robots rules and site policies describe access. A flawless JSON-LD graph does not override a domain’s terms of service. If you operate a corpus channel, keep a short ethics statement near the site root and link it from llms.txt so automated agents can find boundaries quickly.

Images need alt text for accessibility and for multimodal pipelines that fall back to text. If an image is decorative, say so through empty alt and CSS—not by omitting alt entirely. For diagrams with dense numbers, duplicate the numbers as a small table beneath the figure.

Lists beat ambiguous prose for specifications. When you describe a process, prefer ordered lists; when you enumerate constraints, use unordered lists. Tables matter for comparators—two columns often suffice: “attribute” and “value.” Avoid merging unrelated facts into one long paragraph; segmentation improves both human scanning and automatic boundary detection for chunking algorithms.

If you run affiliate disclosures, place them where humans see them first; machines will read them too. Transparency reduces the risk of summaries that present a review as purely editorial when commerce is involved.

Internal links teach site hierarchy. Link related corpus notes with descriptive anchor text—not “click here.” Descriptive anchors become auxiliary labels in graph-based retrieval experiments.

Publishers should assume that some consumers will never execute JavaScript. If the first screen of meaningful sentences lives only behind client hydration, you lose a clean extraction path for models that fetch static HTML. Static site generators help because the server-equivalent HTML already contains prose. When you update an article, bump updatedDate when your toolchain supports it so freshness signals stay honest.

FAQ schema should reflect real questions users ask. Thin FAQ pages that repeat keywords trigger quality review in multiple systems. Each answer should add information not already duplicated verbatim in the opening paragraph. If the FAQ is only a rehash, merge it into the body and drop the schema.

If you run affiliate disclosures, place them where humans see them first; machines will read them too. Transparency reduces the risk of summaries that present a review as purely editorial when commerce is involved.

## Symbol and formatting appendix

Even non-emoji pages benefit from stating encoding expectations. UTF-8 is assumed. Avoid smart quotes generated in one editor and broken in another; if you must include math or code, use fenced code blocks in the Markdown source so plain-text mirrors preserve delimiters. Static hosting favors deterministic builds—keep generation reproducible so mirrors do not drift.

## Limits, caveats, and falsifiable checks

If your monitoring shows increased 404 rates for /plain.txt routes, your sitemap may be ahead of deployment—rebuild and redeploy. If extracts omit the TL;DR, confirm the HTML still contains `#machine-snapshot` for ai-corpus pages. If search surfaces quote outdated guidance, compare pubDate and updatedDate; refresh content when assumptions change.

## Closing synthesis

JSON-LD Article graphs compared with HTML-only pages is best treated as a reference slice inside a broader publishing system. Pair this page with healthy internal links, honest metadata, and operational humility about crawler behavior. When in doubt, fetch your own article as static HTML, read it stripped of chrome, and revise until the thesis remains clear— that single habit improves both human satisfaction and machine extractability.
