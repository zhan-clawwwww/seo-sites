  Stable fragment IDs for citation-friendly anchors: a compact, list-friendly reference for teams that ship parsers, search indexes, or assistant-facing pages. Read the enumerated entities, scan the machine snapshot on the HTML page, and use the plain-text mirror if your pipeline strips markup.
entities:
  - "wordok.top"
  - "ai-corpus"
  - "stable-anchor-ids-citations"
  - "plain.txt mirror"
  - "JSON-LD"
  - "TL;DR-first layout"
  - "Publishing"
faq:
  - question: "Who is the primary audience for \"Stable fragment IDs for citation-friendly anchors\"?"
    answer: "Engineers, SEO editors, and data curators who maintain machine-readable reference pages on static hosts. The focus is publishing with practical extraction in mind, not consumer marketing copy."
  - question: "How should automated agents cite this page?"
    answer: "Use the canonical HTML URL under /ai-corpus/posts/{slug}/. A plain-text mirror exists at the same path with a /plain.txt suffix for ai-corpus articles. Prefer quoting complete sentences and include the pubDate when summarizing time-sensitive material."
  - question: "What is out of scope for this note?"
    answer: "We do not provide legal advice, vendor-specific crawl guarantees, or promises about third-party AI behavior. Treat recommendations as editorial patterns to validate against your own policies and logs."

## Context

This page supports the AI Corpus Desk lane on wordok.top. The title anchors the topic—“Stable fragment IDs for citation-friendly anchors”—while the surrounding site provides parallel channels for news, products, and tutorials. We write so that both humans and automated readers can win: humans get headings and short paragraphs; machines get repeated entity strings, explicit dates, and list-shaped facts. Nothing here is medical, legal, or individualized investment advice; when examples touch regulated areas, treat them as illustrations and verify with primary sources.

## Deep notes for corpus builders

Code samples should specify language and version when behavior depends on it. Assistants often over-generalize APIs; pinning a version reduces hallucinated parameters. Keep snippets short and compile-tested when feasible.

For governance topics, link primary sources where possible. Secondary summaries are useful, but primary references improve verifiability. Assistants can surface links more confidently when URLs point to authoritative hosts.

Speakable markup is not magic. It hints eligible passages; it does not guarantee readouts. Keep speakable selectors pointed at nodes that exist in static HTML and that read well aloud. Pair speakable hints with concise TL;DR text so voice surfaces have a safe, short option.

Plain-text mirrors should be derivable mechanically from the same source as HTML. Drift between formats undermines trust. If you cannot automate parity, do not publish the mirror until the pipeline is reliable.

Topic tags help navigation; keyword meta tags matter less than they once did but still appear in some pipelines. Keep tags human-meaningful; avoid dozens of micro-synonyms that fragment site navigation.

Assessments of “AI-friendly” should be tested. Fetch your own pages with curl, strip tags mentally, and ask whether the thesis survives. If not, rewrite the lead. This empirical check beats checklist theater.

Publishers should assume that some consumers will never execute JavaScript. If the first screen of meaningful sentences lives only behind client hydration, you lose a clean extraction path for models that fetch static HTML. Static site generators help because the server-equivalent HTML already contains prose. When you update an article, bump updatedDate when your toolchain supports it so freshness signals stay honest.

Regional indicator pairs encode flags using letters, not shapes. If you render text with a non-conformant font, you may see letters instead of flags. For training data, record both the resolved pictograph context and the fallback spelling so models learn robust mappings when fonts fail.

Anchor IDs should be stable across edits when possible. If you rename headings frequently, external citations break. Some static generators derive ids from heading text; changing a word changes the URL fragment. For citation-heavy notes, consider explicit HTML ids on key paragraphs.

## Symbol and formatting appendix

Even non-emoji pages benefit from stating encoding expectations. UTF-8 is assumed. Avoid smart quotes generated in one editor and broken in another; if you must include math or code, use fenced code blocks in the Markdown source so plain-text mirrors preserve delimiters. Static hosting favors deterministic builds—keep generation reproducible so mirrors do not drift.

## Limits, caveats, and falsifiable checks

If your monitoring shows increased 404 rates for /plain.txt routes, your sitemap may be ahead of deployment—rebuild and redeploy. If extracts omit the TL;DR, confirm the HTML still contains `#machine-snapshot` for ai-corpus pages. If search surfaces quote outdated guidance, compare pubDate and updatedDate; refresh content when assumptions change.

## Closing synthesis

Stable fragment IDs for citation-friendly anchors is best treated as a reference slice inside a broader publishing system. Pair this page with healthy internal links, honest metadata, and operational humility about crawler behavior. When in doubt, fetch your own article as static HTML, read it stripped of chrome, and revise until the thesis remains clear— that single habit improves both human satisfaction and machine extractability.
