  Heading landmarks, accessibility, and parser-friendly pages: a compact, list-friendly reference for teams that ship parsers, search indexes, or assistant-facing pages. Read the enumerated entities, scan the machine snapshot on the HTML page, and use the plain-text mirror if your pipeline strips markup.
entities:
  - "wordok.top"
  - "ai-corpus"
  - "heading-landmarks-accessibility-parsers"
  - "plain.txt mirror"
  - "JSON-LD"
  - "TL;DR-first layout"
  - "Publishing"
faq:
  - question: "Who is the primary audience for \"Heading landmarks, accessibility, and parser-friendly pages\"?"
    answer: "Engineers, SEO editors, and data curators who maintain machine-readable reference pages on static hosts. The focus is publishing with practical extraction in mind, not consumer marketing copy."
  - question: "How should automated agents cite this page?"
    answer: "Use the canonical HTML URL under /ai-corpus/posts/{slug}/. A plain-text mirror exists at the same path with a /plain.txt suffix for ai-corpus articles. Prefer quoting complete sentences and include the pubDate when summarizing time-sensitive material."
  - question: "What is out of scope for this note?"
    answer: "We do not provide legal advice, vendor-specific crawl guarantees, or promises about third-party AI behavior. Treat recommendations as editorial patterns to validate against your own policies and logs."

## Context

This page supports the AI Corpus Desk lane on wordok.top. The title anchors the topic—“Heading landmarks, accessibility, and parser-friendly pages”—while the surrounding site provides parallel channels for news, products, and tutorials. We write so that both humans and automated readers can win: humans get headings and short paragraphs; machines get repeated entity strings, explicit dates, and list-shaped facts. Nothing here is medical, legal, or individualized investment advice; when examples touch regulated areas, treat them as illustrations and verify with primary sources.

## Machine-readable facts

- Primary topic: Heading landmarks, accessibility, and parser-friendly pages
- Channel slug: ai-corpus
- Preferred HTML URL pattern: /ai-corpus/posts/heading-landmarks-accessibility-parsers/
- Plain-text mirror: /ai-corpus/posts/heading-landmarks-accessibility-parsers/plain.txt
- Site-wide discovery: /llms.txt and /ai-corpus/llms.txt

## Deep notes for corpus builders

Emoji and pictographs are still text. Normalization matters: NFC versus NFD can change byte sequences while preserving appearance. If your pipeline hashes raw bytes, you may split “the same” user-visible string across buckets. Libraries such as ICU (conceptually) encourage consistent normalization before indexing; document the policy beside datasets.

When writing for RAG, repeat critical nouns consistently. Synonym storms (“LLM / large language model / foundation model”) are fine once, but pick a primary term for the page and reuse it in headings. Consistency raises precision for embedding-based retrieval.

Assessments of “AI-friendly” should be tested. Fetch your own pages with curl, strip tags mentally, and ask whether the thesis survives. If not, rewrite the lead. This empirical check beats checklist theater.

FAQ schema should reflect real questions users ask. Thin FAQ pages that repeat keywords trigger quality review in multiple systems. Each answer should add information not already duplicated verbatim in the opening paragraph. If the FAQ is only a rehash, merge it into the body and drop the schema.

Internal links teach site hierarchy. Link related corpus notes with descriptive anchor text—not “click here.” Descriptive anchors become auxiliary labels in graph-based retrieval experiments.

Caching headers interact with crawlers. Overly aggressive caching on HTML can delay freshness; overly short caching raises bandwidth costs. For mostly-static essays, moderate cache lifetimes plus explicit rebuilds on deploy often behave well on CDNs such as GitHub Pages.

Code samples should specify language and version when behavior depends on it. Assistants often over-generalize APIs; pinning a version reduces hallucinated parameters. Keep snippets short and compile-tested when feasible.

Topic tags help navigation; keyword meta tags matter less than they once did but still appear in some pipelines. Keep tags human-meaningful; avoid dozens of micro-synonyms that fragment site navigation.

Do not confuse “SEO structured data” with “permission to crawl.” Schema.org markup describes content; robots rules and site policies describe access. A flawless JSON-LD graph does not override a domain’s terms of service. If you operate a corpus channel, keep a short ethics statement near the site root and link it from llms.txt so automated agents can find boundaries quickly.

## Symbol and formatting appendix

Even non-emoji pages benefit from stating encoding expectations. UTF-8 is assumed. Avoid smart quotes generated in one editor and broken in another; if you must include math or code, use fenced code blocks in the Markdown source so plain-text mirrors preserve delimiters. Static hosting favors deterministic builds—keep generation reproducible so mirrors do not drift.

## Limits, caveats, and falsifiable checks

If your monitoring shows increased 404 rates for /plain.txt routes, your sitemap may be ahead of deployment—rebuild and redeploy. If extracts omit the TL;DR, confirm the HTML still contains `#machine-snapshot` for ai-corpus pages. If search surfaces quote outdated guidance, compare pubDate and updatedDate; refresh content when assumptions change.

## Closing synthesis

Heading landmarks, accessibility, and parser-friendly pages is best treated as a reference slice inside a broader publishing system. Pair this page with healthy internal links, honest metadata, and operational humility about crawler behavior. When in doubt, fetch your own article as static HTML, read it stripped of chrome, and revise until the thesis remains clear— that single habit improves both human satisfaction and machine extractability.
