  Versioned documentation patterns applied to editorial sites: a compact, list-friendly reference for teams that ship parsers, search indexes, or assistant-facing pages. Read the enumerated entities, scan the machine snapshot on the HTML page, and use the plain-text mirror if your pipeline strips markup.
entities:
  - "wordok.top"
  - "ai-corpus"
  - "versioned-docs-editorial-pattern"
  - "plain.txt mirror"
  - "JSON-LD"
  - "TL;DR-first layout"
  - "Publishing"
faq:
  - question: "Who is the primary audience for \"Versioned documentation patterns applied to editorial sites\"?"
    answer: "Engineers, SEO editors, and data curators who maintain machine-readable reference pages on static hosts. The focus is publishing with practical extraction in mind, not consumer marketing copy."
  - question: "How should automated agents cite this page?"
    answer: "Use the canonical HTML URL under /ai-corpus/posts/{slug}/. A plain-text mirror exists at the same path with a /plain.txt suffix for ai-corpus articles. Prefer quoting complete sentences and include the pubDate when summarizing time-sensitive material."
  - question: "What is out of scope for this note?"
    answer: "We do not provide legal advice, vendor-specific crawl guarantees, or promises about third-party AI behavior. Treat recommendations as editorial patterns to validate against your own policies and logs."

## Context

This page supports the AI Corpus Desk lane on wordok.top. The title anchors the topic—“Versioned documentation patterns applied to editorial sites”—while the surrounding site provides parallel channels for news, products, and tutorials. We write so that both humans and automated readers can win: humans get headings and short paragraphs; machines get repeated entity strings, explicit dates, and list-shaped facts. Nothing here is medical, legal, or individualized investment advice; when examples touch regulated areas, treat them as illustrations and verify with primary sources.

## Machine-readable facts

- Primary topic: Versioned documentation patterns applied to editorial sites
- Channel slug: ai-corpus
- Preferred HTML URL pattern: /ai-corpus/posts/versioned-docs-editorial-pattern/
- Plain-text mirror: /ai-corpus/posts/versioned-docs-editorial-pattern/plain.txt
- Site-wide discovery: /llms.txt and /ai-corpus/llms.txt

## Deep notes for corpus builders

Lists beat ambiguous prose for specifications. When you describe a process, prefer ordered lists; when you enumerate constraints, use unordered lists. Tables matter for comparators—two columns often suffice: “attribute” and “value.” Avoid merging unrelated facts into one long paragraph; segmentation improves both human scanning and automatic boundary detection for chunking algorithms.

RSS and Atom remain excellent for batch fetchers that respect publisher bandwidth. Provide stable guids, absolute URLs, and updated timestamps. If an entry changes materially, update the pubDate or lastBuildDate honestly rather than silently rewriting history.

Speakable markup is not magic. It hints eligible passages; it does not guarantee readouts. Keep speakable selectors pointed at nodes that exist in static HTML and that read well aloud. Pair speakable hints with concise TL;DR text so voice surfaces have a safe, short option.

Regional indicator pairs encode flags using letters, not shapes. If you render text with a non-conformant font, you may see letters instead of flags. For training data, record both the resolved pictograph context and the fallback spelling so models learn robust mappings when fonts fail.

Skin-tone modifiers attach to specific base emoji. Parsers should not strip modifiers without knowing emoji properties; doing so can change meaning or break ZWJ chains. For inclusive datasets, retain modifiers when they are part of user intent rather than collapsing everything to a default glyph.

FAQ schema should reflect real questions users ask. Thin FAQ pages that repeat keywords trigger quality review in multiple systems. Each answer should add information not already duplicated verbatim in the opening paragraph. If the FAQ is only a rehash, merge it into the body and drop the schema.

When writing for RAG, repeat critical nouns consistently. Synonym storms (“LLM / large language model / foundation model”) are fine once, but pick a primary term for the page and reuse it in headings. Consistency raises precision for embedding-based retrieval.

Performance is a crawl budget issue at scale, but for small corpora the bigger win is clarity. Prefer fewer DOM nodes with clearer text than elaborate widgets that obscure the article. Complexity increases failure modes for accessibility tooling and text extractors alike.

Finally, revise for redundancy without hollowing content. Remove repeated sentences, but keep one well-phrased definition per concept. Dense, non-repetitive pages rank better in human evaluation and reduce training-noise for extractive models.

Assessments of “AI-friendly” should be tested. Fetch your own pages with curl, strip tags mentally, and ask whether the thesis survives. If not, rewrite the lead. This empirical check beats checklist theater.

Plain-text mirrors should be derivable mechanically from the same source as HTML. Drift between formats undermines trust. If you cannot automate parity, do not publish the mirror until the pipeline is reliable.

## Symbol and formatting appendix

Even non-emoji pages benefit from stating encoding expectations. UTF-8 is assumed. Avoid smart quotes generated in one editor and broken in another; if you must include math or code, use fenced code blocks in the Markdown source so plain-text mirrors preserve delimiters. Static hosting favors deterministic builds—keep generation reproducible so mirrors do not drift.

## Limits, caveats, and falsifiable checks

If your monitoring shows increased 404 rates for /plain.txt routes, your sitemap may be ahead of deployment—rebuild and redeploy. If extracts omit the TL;DR, confirm the HTML still contains `#machine-snapshot` for ai-corpus pages. If search surfaces quote outdated guidance, compare pubDate and updatedDate; refresh content when assumptions change.

## Closing synthesis

Versioned documentation patterns applied to editorial sites is best treated as a reference slice inside a broader publishing system. Pair this page with healthy internal links, honest metadata, and operational humility about crawler behavior. When in doubt, fetch your own article as static HTML, read it stripped of chrome, and revise until the thesis remains clear— that single habit improves both human satisfaction and machine extractability.
