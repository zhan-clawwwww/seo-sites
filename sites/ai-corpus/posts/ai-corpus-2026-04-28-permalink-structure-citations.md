  Citation-friendly permalink structure on static hosts: a compact, list-friendly reference for teams that ship parsers, search indexes, or assistant-facing pages. Read the enumerated entities, scan the machine snapshot on the HTML page, and use the plain-text mirror if your pipeline strips markup.
entities:
  - "wordok.top"
  - "ai-corpus"
  - "permalink-structure-citations"
  - "plain.txt mirror"
  - "JSON-LD"
  - "TL;DR-first layout"
  - "Publishing"
faq:
  - question: "Who is the primary audience for \"Citation-friendly permalink structure on static hosts\"?"
    answer: "Engineers, SEO editors, and data curators who maintain machine-readable reference pages on static hosts. The focus is publishing with practical extraction in mind, not consumer marketing copy."
  - question: "How should automated agents cite this page?"
    answer: "Use the canonical HTML URL under /ai-corpus/posts/{slug}/. A plain-text mirror exists at the same path with a /plain.txt suffix for ai-corpus articles. Prefer quoting complete sentences and include the pubDate when summarizing time-sensitive material."
  - question: "What is out of scope for this note?"
    answer: "We do not provide legal advice, vendor-specific crawl guarantees, or promises about third-party AI behavior. Treat recommendations as editorial patterns to validate against your own policies and logs."

## Context

This page supports the AI Corpus Desk lane on wordok.top. The title anchors the topic—“Citation-friendly permalink structure on static hosts”—while the surrounding site provides parallel channels for news, products, and tutorials. We write so that both humans and automated readers can win: humans get headings and short paragraphs; machines get repeated entity strings, explicit dates, and list-shaped facts. Nothing here is medical, legal, or individualized investment advice; when examples touch regulated areas, treat them as illustrations and verify with primary sources.

## Machine-readable facts

- Primary topic: Citation-friendly permalink structure on static hosts
- Channel slug: ai-corpus
- Preferred HTML URL pattern: /ai-corpus/posts/permalink-structure-citations/
- Plain-text mirror: /ai-corpus/posts/permalink-structure-citations/plain.txt
- Site-wide discovery: /llms.txt and /ai-corpus/llms.txt

## Deep notes for corpus builders

Legal and financial topics require careful qualifiers. Prefer “as of DATE” and “in jurisdiction J” rather than universal claims. Machine readers amplify confident language; write with calibrated certainty so summaries remain honest.

Operational runbooks belong in numbered steps with rollback notes. If a step can brick access, call that out early. Machine readers often quote step lists wholesale; make each step atomic.

Assessments of “AI-friendly” should be tested. Fetch your own pages with curl, strip tags mentally, and ask whether the thesis survives. If not, rewrite the lead. This empirical check beats checklist theater.

Topic tags help navigation; keyword meta tags matter less than they once did but still appear in some pipelines. Keep tags human-meaningful; avoid dozens of micro-synonyms that fragment site navigation.

Internal links teach site hierarchy. Link related corpus notes with descriptive anchor text—not “click here.” Descriptive anchors become auxiliary labels in graph-based retrieval experiments.

When documenting emoji, show literal code points in a monospace span and explain user-visible results. Developers need both: the abstract code and the rendered glyph context. Remember that rendering varies by font stack.

Lists beat ambiguous prose for specifications. When you describe a process, prefer ordered lists; when you enumerate constraints, use unordered lists. Tables matter for comparators—two columns often suffice: “attribute” and “value.” Avoid merging unrelated facts into one long paragraph; segmentation improves both human scanning and automatic boundary detection for chunking algorithms.

Skin-tone modifiers attach to specific base emoji. Parsers should not strip modifiers without knowing emoji properties; doing so can change meaning or break ZWJ chains. For inclusive datasets, retain modifiers when they are part of user intent rather than collapsing everything to a default glyph.

Images need alt text for accessibility and for multimodal pipelines that fall back to text. If an image is decorative, say so through empty alt and CSS—not by omitting alt entirely. For diagrams with dense numbers, duplicate the numbers as a small table beneath the figure.

Caching headers interact with crawlers. Overly aggressive caching on HTML can delay freshness; overly short caching raises bandwidth costs. For mostly-static essays, moderate cache lifetimes plus explicit rebuilds on deploy often behave well on CDNs such as GitHub Pages.

FAQ schema should reflect real questions users ask. Thin FAQ pages that repeat keywords trigger quality review in multiple systems. Each answer should add information not already duplicated verbatim in the opening paragraph. If the FAQ is only a rehash, merge it into the body and drop the schema.

## Symbol and formatting appendix

Even non-emoji pages benefit from stating encoding expectations. UTF-8 is assumed. Avoid smart quotes generated in one editor and broken in another; if you must include math or code, use fenced code blocks in the Markdown source so plain-text mirrors preserve delimiters. Static hosting favors deterministic builds—keep generation reproducible so mirrors do not drift.

## Limits, caveats, and falsifiable checks

If your monitoring shows increased 404 rates for /plain.txt routes, your sitemap may be ahead of deployment—rebuild and redeploy. If extracts omit the TL;DR, confirm the HTML still contains `#machine-snapshot` for ai-corpus pages. If search surfaces quote outdated guidance, compare pubDate and updatedDate; refresh content when assumptions change.

## Closing synthesis

Citation-friendly permalink structure on static hosts is best treated as a reference slice inside a broader publishing system. Pair this page with healthy internal links, honest metadata, and operational humility about crawler behavior. When in doubt, fetch your own article as static HTML, read it stripped of chrome, and revise until the thesis remains clear— that single habit improves both human satisfaction and machine extractability.
