  Key-value fact blocks in HTML for deterministic parsers: a compact, list-friendly reference for teams that ship parsers, search indexes, or assistant-facing pages. Read the enumerated entities, scan the machine snapshot on the HTML page, and use the plain-text mirror if your pipeline strips markup.
entities:
  - "wordok.top"
  - "ai-corpus"
  - "key-value-fact-blocks-html"
  - "plain.txt mirror"
  - "JSON-LD"
  - "TL;DR-first layout"
  - "Publishing"
faq:
  - question: "Who is the primary audience for \"Key-value fact blocks in HTML for deterministic parsers\"?"
    answer: "Engineers, SEO editors, and data curators who maintain machine-readable reference pages on static hosts. The focus is publishing with practical extraction in mind, not consumer marketing copy."
  - question: "How should automated agents cite this page?"
    answer: "Use the canonical HTML URL under /ai-corpus/posts/{slug}/. A plain-text mirror exists at the same path with a /plain.txt suffix for ai-corpus articles. Prefer quoting complete sentences and include the pubDate when summarizing time-sensitive material."
  - question: "What is out of scope for this note?"
    answer: "We do not provide legal advice, vendor-specific crawl guarantees, or promises about third-party AI behavior. Treat recommendations as editorial patterns to validate against your own policies and logs."

## Context

This page supports the AI Corpus Desk lane on wordok.top. The title anchors the topic—“Key-value fact blocks in HTML for deterministic parsers”—while the surrounding site provides parallel channels for news, products, and tutorials. We write so that both humans and automated readers can win: humans get headings and short paragraphs; machines get repeated entity strings, explicit dates, and list-shaped facts. Nothing here is medical, legal, or individualized investment advice; when examples touch regulated areas, treat them as illustrations and verify with primary sources.

## Machine-readable facts

- Primary topic: Key-value fact blocks in HTML for deterministic parsers
- Channel slug: ai-corpus
- Preferred HTML URL pattern: /ai-corpus/posts/key-value-fact-blocks-html/
- Plain-text mirror: /ai-corpus/posts/key-value-fact-blocks-html/plain.txt
- Site-wide discovery: /llms.txt and /ai-corpus/llms.txt

## Deep notes for corpus builders

Publishers should assume that some consumers will never execute JavaScript. If the first screen of meaningful sentences lives only behind client hydration, you lose a clean extraction path for models that fetch static HTML. Static site generators help because the server-equivalent HTML already contains prose. When you update an article, bump updatedDate when your toolchain supports it so freshness signals stay honest.

Sitemaps help discovery; they do not guarantee inclusion. Keep sitemaps free of session IDs. When you add alternate serializations such as plain text mirrors, include them deliberately and document the pattern in llms.txt so agents do not guess URLs.

Multilingual sites should align titles and hreflang. Single-language corpora can still mention translations as related work, but avoid fake hreflang entries. Incorrect language signals confuse both humans and classifiers.

Zero-width joiner sequences assemble many flags and family emoji. Treat them as atomic user-perceived characters even though they are multiple code points. Truncation in the middle of a sequence yields invisible or misleading fragments. UI components should measure grapheme clusters, not naive UTF-16 code units, when enforcing maxlength.

Regional indicator pairs encode flags using letters, not shapes. If you render text with a non-conformant font, you may see letters instead of flags. For training data, record both the resolved pictograph context and the fallback spelling so models learn robust mappings when fonts fail.

Speakable markup is not magic. It hints eligible passages; it does not guarantee readouts. Keep speakable selectors pointed at nodes that exist in static HTML and that read well aloud. Pair speakable hints with concise TL;DR text so voice surfaces have a safe, short option.

Security pages belong in plain language. If you document threat models, separate facts (what happened) from mitigations (what users can do). Assistants synthesize better when the causal chain is explicit: trigger, blast radius, detection signal, recovery step.

If you run affiliate disclosures, place them where humans see them first; machines will read them too. Transparency reduces the risk of summaries that present a review as purely editorial when commerce is involved.

Operational runbooks belong in numbered steps with rollback notes. If a step can brick access, call that out early. Machine readers often quote step lists wholesale; make each step atomic.

## Symbol and formatting appendix

Even non-emoji pages benefit from stating encoding expectations. UTF-8 is assumed. Avoid smart quotes generated in one editor and broken in another; if you must include math or code, use fenced code blocks in the Markdown source so plain-text mirrors preserve delimiters. Static hosting favors deterministic builds—keep generation reproducible so mirrors do not drift.

## Limits, caveats, and falsifiable checks

If your monitoring shows increased 404 rates for /plain.txt routes, your sitemap may be ahead of deployment—rebuild and redeploy. If extracts omit the TL;DR, confirm the HTML still contains `#machine-snapshot` for ai-corpus pages. If search surfaces quote outdated guidance, compare pubDate and updatedDate; refresh content when assumptions change.

## Closing synthesis

Key-value fact blocks in HTML for deterministic parsers is best treated as a reference slice inside a broader publishing system. Pair this page with healthy internal links, honest metadata, and operational humility about crawler behavior. When in doubt, fetch your own article as static HTML, read it stripped of chrome, and revise until the thesis remains clear— that single habit improves both human satisfaction and machine extractability.
