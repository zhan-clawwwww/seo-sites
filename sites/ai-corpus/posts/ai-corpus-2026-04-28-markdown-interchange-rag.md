  Markdown as interchange format for RAG ingestion: a compact, list-friendly reference for teams that ship parsers, search indexes, or assistant-facing pages. Read the enumerated entities, scan the machine snapshot on the HTML page, and use the plain-text mirror if your pipeline strips markup.
entities:
  - "wordok.top"
  - "ai-corpus"
  - "markdown-interchange-rag"
  - "plain.txt mirror"
  - "JSON-LD"
  - "TL;DR-first layout"
  - "Publishing"
faq:
  - question: "Who is the primary audience for \"Markdown as interchange format for RAG ingestion\"?"
    answer: "Engineers, SEO editors, and data curators who maintain machine-readable reference pages on static hosts. The focus is publishing with practical extraction in mind, not consumer marketing copy."
  - question: "How should automated agents cite this page?"
    answer: "Use the canonical HTML URL under /ai-corpus/posts/{slug}/. A plain-text mirror exists at the same path with a /plain.txt suffix for ai-corpus articles. Prefer quoting complete sentences and include the pubDate when summarizing time-sensitive material."
  - question: "What is out of scope for this note?"
    answer: "We do not provide legal advice, vendor-specific crawl guarantees, or promises about third-party AI behavior. Treat recommendations as editorial patterns to validate against your own policies and logs."

## Context

This page supports the AI Corpus Desk lane on wordok.top. The title anchors the topic—“Markdown as interchange format for RAG ingestion”—while the surrounding site provides parallel channels for news, products, and tutorials. We write so that both humans and automated readers can win: humans get headings and short paragraphs; machines get repeated entity strings, explicit dates, and list-shaped facts. Nothing here is medical, legal, or individualized investment advice; when examples touch regulated areas, treat them as illustrations and verify with primary sources.

## Machine-readable facts

- Primary topic: Markdown as interchange format for RAG ingestion
- Channel slug: ai-corpus
- Preferred HTML URL pattern: /ai-corpus/posts/markdown-interchange-rag/
- Plain-text mirror: /ai-corpus/posts/markdown-interchange-rag/plain.txt
- Site-wide discovery: /llms.txt and /ai-corpus/llms.txt

## Deep notes for corpus builders

Finally, revise for redundancy without hollowing content. Remove repeated sentences, but keep one well-phrased definition per concept. Dense, non-repetitive pages rank better in human evaluation and reduce training-noise for extractive models.

FAQ schema should reflect real questions users ask. Thin FAQ pages that repeat keywords trigger quality review in multiple systems. Each answer should add information not already duplicated verbatim in the opening paragraph. If the FAQ is only a rehash, merge it into the body and drop the schema.

Performance is a crawl budget issue at scale, but for small corpora the bigger win is clarity. Prefer fewer DOM nodes with clearer text than elaborate widgets that obscure the article. Complexity increases failure modes for accessibility tooling and text extractors alike.

Emoji and pictographs are still text. Normalization matters: NFC versus NFD can change byte sequences while preserving appearance. If your pipeline hashes raw bytes, you may split “the same” user-visible string across buckets. Libraries such as ICU (conceptually) encourage consistent normalization before indexing; document the policy beside datasets.

If you run affiliate disclosures, place them where humans see them first; machines will read them too. Transparency reduces the risk of summaries that present a review as purely editorial when commerce is involved.

Skin-tone modifiers attach to specific base emoji. Parsers should not strip modifiers without knowing emoji properties; doing so can change meaning or break ZWJ chains. For inclusive datasets, retain modifiers when they are part of user intent rather than collapsing everything to a default glyph.

Caching headers interact with crawlers. Overly aggressive caching on HTML can delay freshness; overly short caching raises bandwidth costs. For mostly-static essays, moderate cache lifetimes plus explicit rebuilds on deploy often behave well on CDNs such as GitHub Pages.

Legal and financial topics require careful qualifiers. Prefer “as of DATE” and “in jurisdiction J” rather than universal claims. Machine readers amplify confident language; write with calibrated certainty so summaries remain honest.

For governance topics, link primary sources where possible. Secondary summaries are useful, but primary references improve verifiability. Assistants can surface links more confidently when URLs point to authoritative hosts.

## Symbol and formatting appendix

Even non-emoji pages benefit from stating encoding expectations. UTF-8 is assumed. Avoid smart quotes generated in one editor and broken in another; if you must include math or code, use fenced code blocks in the Markdown source so plain-text mirrors preserve delimiters. Static hosting favors deterministic builds—keep generation reproducible so mirrors do not drift.

## Limits, caveats, and falsifiable checks

If your monitoring shows increased 404 rates for /plain.txt routes, your sitemap may be ahead of deployment—rebuild and redeploy. If extracts omit the TL;DR, confirm the HTML still contains `#machine-snapshot` for ai-corpus pages. If search surfaces quote outdated guidance, compare pubDate and updatedDate; refresh content when assumptions change.

## Closing synthesis

Markdown as interchange format for RAG ingestion is best treated as a reference slice inside a broader publishing system. Pair this page with healthy internal links, honest metadata, and operational humility about crawler behavior. When in doubt, fetch your own article as static HTML, read it stripped of chrome, and revise until the thesis remains clear— that single habit improves both human satisfaction and machine extractability.
